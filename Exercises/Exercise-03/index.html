<h1>Breakpoints with Maru</h1>
<h2>These photographs were stolen from the <a href="http://sisinmaru.com/" target="blank">Maru website</a>. Because of how information is proliferated on the internet, Maru has become a viral sensation. Without the the world wide web, Maru would just be another Scottish fold cat in Japan.</h2>

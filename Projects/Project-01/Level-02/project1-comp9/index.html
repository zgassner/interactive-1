			<em>some nights I sleep with my dress on.</em>

			my teeth are small and even.

			<em>i don’t get headaches.</em>

			since 1971 or before, I have hunted a bench where I could eat my pimento cheese in peace.

			<em>if this were tennessee and across that river, arkansas, I’d meet you in west memphis tonight.</em>

			i’m still trying to find a job for which a simple machine isn’t better suited.

			<em>i’ve seen people die of money.</em>

			look at admiral benbow.

			<em>i wish like certain fishes, we came equipped with light organs.</em>

			which reminds me of a little known fact: if we were going the speed of light,

			<em>isn’t the road crooked and steep.</em>

			in this humidity, I make repairs by night.

			<em>i’m not one among millions who saw monroe’s face in the moon.</em>

			i go blank looking at that face.

			<em>i won awards in spelling and the australian crawl.</em>

			long long ago. grandmother married a man named ivan.

			<em>the men called him eve.</em>

			stranger, to tell the truth, in dog years I am up there.
